## Tutorial

### Copy css file to your css directory:

### Copy js file to your css directory:
`yourProjectPath/css/captain-consents-cookie-consent.js`

### Load your js file just before the closing tag of </body>.

**TROUBLESHOOTING:** Load cookie-consent.js at the end of the body to avoid **"Uncaught TypeError cannot read property 'addeventlistener' of null"** issue. 
In other words, load html first, then js.: \
